Load "Demonic_Hell_Portal.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the Demonic Portal effect from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

Click the left mouse button to trigger the portal.

Note that when using the portal prefab you should set the asset to the same position on the Y axis as the ground; this ensures the depth mask sits just above the ground surface.

To avoid sorting issues with the particles (especially with the pentagon symbol not showing clearing on the ground), it is advisable to turn off Soft Particles. This setting can be found under the menu Edit -> Project Settings -> Quality

Have fun!
