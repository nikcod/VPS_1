v1.0.3

v1.0.2
	- Fixed a bug that caused the Native Android Debugger to not monitor the SDK path in some cases.

v1.0.1
	- Now the officially supported minimum version is Unity 2019.4 or higher. Support for this version of Unity or
	  higher will make it possible to add different new features and improvements in the future. This change also aims
	  to ensure that the tool can always have mature, stable and continuous update support!

v1.0.0
	- The Native Android Debugger has just been released! I will always be working to support and add new features!
	  Do you have any suggestions, Bug reports or any problems with using this asset? Contact by email!
