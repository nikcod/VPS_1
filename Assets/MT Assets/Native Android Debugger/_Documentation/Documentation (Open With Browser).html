                    Native Android Debugger is a tool that will give you better control over your Unity Editor's ADB, giving you the possibility to connect your device over Wi-Fi and send your Builds directly to your Android device without
                    the need for USB Cables over example. You can also do other interesting things.

                    <doc.topictitle>First steps to use</doc.topictitle>

                    Before starting to use Native Android Debugger, you need to fill some preferences necessary for the tool to work. See below for the necessary settings.

                    <doc.topicsubtitle>Fill in "Device Settings"</doc.topicsubtitle>

                    The Native Android Debugger needs to know some information from your device so it can connect your Unity Editor ADB to your Android device over Wi-Fi and thus execute the commands and enable your Unity Editor to send
                    your APKs directly to yours device over Wi-Fi.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You need to tell Native Android Debugger the IP address of your Android device on the local network. You can read the help topics under "Device Settings" to understand more and learn how to configure these settings.

                    <doc.topicsubtitle>Fill in "SDK Settings"</doc.topicsubtitle>

                    In this part, we need to tell the Native Android Debugger, where is the same Android SDK that your Unity Editor uses. Native Android Debugger needs to know where the same Android SDK is located that your Unity Editor
                    uses, so Native Android Debugger can manage it, and connect or disconnect your device to it over Wi-Fi for example.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can perform these settings in "SDK Settings" and again, on this same screen you can read topics to understand more about it and know better how to configure.

                    Follow the step by step below to use this tool.

                    <doc.warn>
                        Note that the main purpose of this tool is to give you the possibility and control so that you can connect your Android device to Unity's ADB via Wi-Fi and then execute ADB commands, send your APKs (Builds) and etc,
                        all over Wi-Fi.
                    </doc.warn>

                    <b>Step 1 -</b> Open the Native Android Debugger window by clicking "Tools > MT Assets > Native Android Debugger > Open Android Debugger Tool", if the window is not already open.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 2 -</b> Make sure the settings in the "Device Settings" and "SDK Settings" tabs have been made.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 3 -</b> Connect your device to Unity's ADB using Native Android Debugger. To do this, go to the "Quick Debug" tab and click on "Connect To Device". When you click on this button, you will be shown a step by step
                    of what to do to connect your device. You can also read the help topics on the "Quick Debug" tab to better understand everything and how to connect your device.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 4 -</b> Once your device is connected, it will be displayed under "Currently Connected Devices", or you can manually check which devices are currently connected by clicking on "List Connected Devices". You can
                    use the buttons in the "Connect Or Disconnect device" and "Device TWELVE System Debug" sections to send these commands to your device.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 5 -</b> Once your device appears as connected in the Native Android Debugger, you can also send your Builds to it directly via Wi-Fi. To do this, go to "File > Build Settings". Make sure the target platform is
                    Android. In "Run Device" select the device you want to send your Build and click "Build And Run".

                    If you're developing for Android, you probably already know the Android SDK and know how to configure it in Unity and so on. This topic is here for clarification purposes, but if you are already familiar with the Android
                    SDK, just skip to the next topic!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Android SDK is a Development Kit for Android system. The Android SDK has a number of libraries, tools and other utilities that are sorely needed when building applications. Whenever you're going to develop something for
                    the Android system, you'll need the Android SDK, whether it's an app or a game. The same goes for Unity. A while ago you needed to provide Unity, an Android SDK so that it could build your APKs for your game, these days,
                    when you download a version of Unity Editor, through Unity Hub, Unity already comes with one Customized version of the Android SDK for Unity's use so you no longer need to download an Android SDK for Unity to use, as it
                    will already have its own Android SDK.
                    <doc.info>
                        When downloading the Unity Editor via Unity Hub and adding the Android module, Unity Hub will ask you if you want to install the Android SDK along with the Editor. This is the most recommended, because then Unity
                        will have an Android SDK recommended for it and customized and that will always keep up with what is necessary for that version of Unity Editor.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Normally your Unity Editor's Android SDK can be found in the following directory...
                        <br>
                        {Installation Location}/20XX.X.XfX/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/SDK
                    </doc.info>
                    Native Android Debugger needs to know where your Unity Editor's Android SDK is so that Native Android Debugger will help you manage it and everything will work as expected! When the Native Android Debugger knows where
                    your Unity Editor's Android SDK is, it can check build information, check if the ADB server is running, execute whatever commands you want, directly in your Unity Editor's Android SDK, and so on.

                    </doc.info>

                    <doc.topicsubtitle>A little about the ADB</doc.topicsubtitle>

                    Android Debug Bridge. ADB is the debugging bridge between your computer and your Android device. ADB is sorely needed for all Native Android Debugger functions to run. ADB is already included in every Android SDK,
                    including the Android SDK that your Unity Editor uses. When you provide the Android SDK path from your Unity Editor to the Native Android Debugger, it will already be able to know where your Android SDK's ADB is. Once
                    the Native Android Debugger knows where the ADB is, it can do everything you want, like running commands, checking if the ADB server is running, connecting or disconnecting your device and so on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unity Editor also uses ADB to send your APK builds directly to your Android device (if you've already used the "Build and Run" option you may have noticed this already). Unity Editor uses ADB to check which devices are
                    connected via USB, and thus send your APK Build directly to your device. Native Android Debugger will help you so that you can connect your device via Wi-Fi, eliminating the use of USB cables, it will help you to see
                    which devices are connected, disconnect certain devices, connect new ones and so on. Once you've taken care of everything with the help of Native Android Debugger, you can use Unity Editor's "Build Settings" window as
                    usual to upload your APKs!

                    With Native Android Debugger you can connect your Android device to your Unity Editor's ADB via Wi-Fi. To connect your device to your Unity Editor's ADB, click on the "Connect To Device" button on the tab "Quick Debug"
                    from Native Android Debugger.
                    <doc.info>
                        Once your Android device is connected, it will appear as an available device in your Unity Editor's "Build Settings" window.

                    You can see which devices are currently connected to your Unity Editor's ADB through the "Currently Connected Devices" section in the "Quick Debug" tab of your Native Android Debugger.

                    <br>
                    If you prefer, you can click the "List Connected Devices" button to run the command to list the devices currently connected to the ADB, then just look at the output of this command to see which devices are currently
                    connected.

                    In Native Android Debugger you can disconnect all ADB devices from your Unity Editor and if you prefer you can disconnect specific devices. The disconnect function only applies to devices that are connected via Wi-Fi and
                    will not disconnect Android devices connected via USB.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can click "Disconnect All Devices" in the "Quick Debug" tab to disconnect all devices, if you click the "Disconnect From Device" button, Native Android Debugger will disconnect the device that is using the IP
                    registered in the settings.

                    <doc.topictitle>Debugger Tool: How to Check/Change device DOZE state</doc.topictitle>

                    Android's DOZE feature was introduced for the purpose of prolonging users' battery life by postponing or scheduling app processes. The device goes into DOZE when it is unplugged from the charger and not in use (with the
                    screen locked) for an extended period of time. This feature can affect the functioning of your app's process, if your app has tasks that run in the background, such as delivery of notifications, scans, network access and
                    so on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    DOZE has several levels, and at deep sleep levels the app's activities are even more restricted. With Native Android Debugger you will be able to see the current DOZE level of your device, as well as force the advance
                    of DOZE and etc levels, so you can debug and see how your app will behave when the Android device is in these DOZE stages.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Read the topic "What is the function of each of the Buttons (Commands) above?" and look up the explanation for the DOZE management buttons to learn more about each level of DOZE.

                    <doc.topictitle>Debugger Tool: How to Start/Stop the ADB Server</doc.topictitle>

                    In order for ADB to communicate with your Android device, it creates a Server so that your device can connect and thus communicate with your computer and ADB. In order to be able to send commands to the ADB and
                    consequently to your device, the ADB Server must be online and running.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you open Native Android Debugger, and the server is not running, NAD will ask you to start the server and you will see a button to start it so you can manage ADB and so on.
                    <br>
                    The ADB Server can also be started automatically by your Unity Editor, if you do a Build, or open the "Build Settings" window.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To shut down the ADB server, just click on "Stop Server of Current ADB" in the "Quick Debug" tab. This can be useful if you want to manage the ADB from another Android SDK other than your Unity Editor, as it is not
                    recommended that 2 ADBs run at the same time.
